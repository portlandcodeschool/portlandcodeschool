          Get over 500 hours of hands-on experience! For 13 weeks, 8 hours a day, you will learn how to BUILD FULL-STACK WEB APPLICATIONS WITH JAVASCRIPT in a collaborative classroom environment. Get real experience from expert instructors – and your peers – learning both front-end and back-end applications of JavaScript, including popular libraries and frameworks such as jQuery and Angular.js, as well as back-end technologies such as Node.js. Every web application needs JavaScript, and the demand for JavaScript developers is only growing!
        </p>

          <strong>Technical Requirements:</strong> You should have a working knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Git/GitHub. Basically, can you build a static website and push it to GitHub? If so, you meet the basic requirements needed to interview for this class.

          <em><strong>NOTE:</strong> Students with NO CODING EXPERIENCE should consider our Primer course before diving in to Full Stack JavaScript (see the Classes page for technical requirements).
          Students will be provided Treehouse accounts, and will be given access to the classroom from 9am-5pm M-F, as well as some Saturdays, leaving lots of time for independent and group learning. Students will primarily be working and learning in groups of 2-4 people.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          A week before classes commence, students will be provided Treehouse accounts and expected to complete a few interactive tutorials. This will ensure all students arrive with a similar baseline of knowledge. Students will be expected to attend classes 9am-5pm M-F, but will also have access to the classroom during off hours allowing additional time for group learning. Students will primarily be working and learning in groups of 2-4 people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Integrating oneself into the Portland tech community is possibly the single best decision a new student can make. Forging connections and friendships by attending tech meetups and events is the best way to do this. We cannot force you to do this, but we will try (in a loving way :)
        </p>
        <p>
          PCS hosts and sponsors community events periodically. Some of these will be organized and run by our students.
          Another powerful way for web developers to put their best foot forward &mdash; and be extra attractive to employers &mdash; is to contribute to open source projects. We will cover best practices and different ways to make this happen during the course.

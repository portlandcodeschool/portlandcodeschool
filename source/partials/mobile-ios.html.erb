        <h4>View <%= link_to "Bit Lore's website", "http://www.bitloremobile.com/portland92815/", :target=>"_blank" %> for details about the class.</h4>
<!--         <p>
          This course will start with the basics that can take (and has commonly taken) people with absolutely no programming experience and given them a solid foundation not only in iOS development, but know proper programming practices that apply to most programming languages so they not only know the lingo, but understand it as well.
        </p>    
        <p>
          Courses are a mix of lecture, assignments, one on one guidance, and a welcoming to the community of iOS development!  Projects are structured in a way to not only reinforce lectured material, but to also show off and establish understanding of the material to others.
        </p> -->
        <p>
          Special Note: There is about a week's worth of pre-course work** to ensure everyone can hit the ground running on day one, so apply today!

          <strong>**Technical Requirements:</strong> Although this class is built for beginners, and has no technical requirements, there is some pre-course work to do (reading a few chapters from "Big Nerd Ranch Guide: Objective-C Programming", and watching some online tutorials).

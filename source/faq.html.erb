<h3>Financial:</h3>

<div class="question">
  <h4><%= link_to "How much do classes cost?", "#" %></h4>
  <div class="answer">
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Part-time class:</strong> (<%= link_to "Full Stack JavaScript Evening", "/javascript.html" %>)</li>

<div class="question">
  <h4><%= link_to "I’ve seen similar classes offered at other code schools that are cheaper. What gives?", "#" %></h4>
  <div class="answer">
    <p>We think that people should explore all their options and find a school that works for them. We think our courses are better, however, and here’s why:
      <ul>
        <li>We use the latest cognitive science to help you develop and apply your own best learning strategies. You learn how to learn</li>
        <li>We use the latest educational techniques so that you 1) learn effectively on your own, AND 2) work on real projects with real teams to accomplish client-focused goals</li>
        <li>Many employers tell us that Portland Code School is their preferred school to hire from. We believe it's because PCS graduates not only understand how to code, they also know how to come up to speed quickly and how to produce work on time, in teams</li>
      </ul>
    Most of all, our classes provide students with time and attention directly from our instructors, all of whom have years of experience with professional development or computer science (or both).</p>

<h3>General:</h3>

<div class="question">
  <h4><%= link_to "There are so many ways to learn programming online. Why should I go to Portland Code School?", "#" %></h4>
    <div class="answer">
    <p>In a word: TEAMWORK.</p>
    <p>It's true that there are many resources online to help you learn to program, many of which are free! So why should you attend Portland Code School?</p>
    <p>At Portland Code School, we provide you with a classroom experience that can't be duplicated by online or remote learning. We emphasize collaborative, project-based learning, pair programming, and provide one-on-one access to instructors. Many of our students have tried to learn online, and found that having experienced developers to ask questions, and a cohort of learners they can rely on, are essential to helpig them making the leap from programming hobbyist to professional developer.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="question">
  <h4><%= link_to "Who are your instructors and support staff?", "#" %></h4>
    <div class="answer">
    <p>Portland Code School is committed to providing our students with faculty and staff who can help you achieve your goals. Our instructors are working tech professionals and educators. <%= link_to "Meet the team!", "/meettheteam.html" %></p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="question">
  <h4><%= link_to "What if I have never coded before?", "#" %></h4>
    <div class="answer">
    <p>That’s perfectly fine. Our <%= link_to "Web Foundations Series", "/webdevelopmentprimer.html" %> is designed to get you the technical skills needed to be accepted into any of our advanced classes. Those skills include HTML, CSS, version control (specifically git), collaborative workflows using GitHub, how to use the Chrome Developer Tools, and Sublime Text. If you do not yet possess those skills, we recommend <%= link_to "enrolling", "enroll.html" %> in our <%= link_to "Web Foundations Series", "/webdevelopmentprimer.html" %> class.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="question">
  <h4><%= link_to "Which class is best for me?", "#" %></h4>
    <div class="answer">
    <p>This is a great question, and is highly dependent on your personal learning and career goals. We recommend checking our <%= link_to "course descriptions", "/classes.html" %> and <%= link_to "contacting us", "/contact.html" %> to help you get a better idea of what skills you’ll get out of each class, and which class will best meet your needs.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="question">
  <h4><%= link_to "Does Portland Code School offer a diploma or a certificate?", "#" %></h4>
    <div class="answer">
    <p>Starting this fall, we are entering into a partnership with <%= link_to "PCC CLIMB", "http://www.pcc.edu/climb/", :target=>"_blank" %>, so our graduation certificates will soon qualify for CEUs at community colleges, and will be officially recognized certificates.</p>
    <p>Although we have an excellent reputation among employers who are constantly asking us for more graduates, many people still aren't familiar with the value code schools provide compared to universities and community colleges. So, along with the certificate, we make sure all our successful students finish the course with:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>A portfolio (and GitHub repositories) that demonstrates their abilities</li>
        <li>A proven track record of learning both soft and hard skills quickly and applying them effectively</li>
        <li>Training and practice in job hunting and interviewing techniques</li>
        <li>A network of peers, recruiters, and potential employers</li>
        <li>Recommendations from instructors</li>
      </ul>

    <p>In the end, it’s your professional network and proven skill set that gets you jobs. We help you build both.</p>

<div class="question">
  <h4><%= link_to "What is the difference between Full-Stack JavaScript Evening vs. Immersion?", "#" %></h4>
    <div class="answer">
    <p>In a word, scheduling! We want to accommodate the varying schedules and learning styles of our students.</p>

    <p>For students who are self-directed, work a day job, or who prefer evening classes for personal reasons, we offer the <%= link_to "Full-Stack JavaScript Evening Class", "/javascript.html" %>. The evening class meets two nights each week for three hours a night, as well as one Saturday per month. Students are expected to study for about 3 hours outside of class for every hour in class (about 18 hours per week outside of class). Instructors and TAs hold office hours (open labs) every day of the week that class is not held (except Fridays). Furthermore, students are provided full access to Portland Code School facilities during school hours (M-F, 9am - 9pm + most Saturdays). This class runs for a full 18 weeks.</p>

    <p>We offer the <%= link_to "Full-Stack JavaScript Immersion Class", "/javascriptimmersion.html" %> for students who want more dedicated instruction time during regular daytime hours. The class meets from 9 AM - 5 PM Monday through Friday for 13 weeks. This class provides over 500 hours of dedicated instruction time, weekly tours of tech companies, job readiness training with professional recruiters, and a project showcase event shortly after graduation.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="question">
  <h4><%= link_to "What happens if I can't keep up, or if I find that programming is not for me?", "#" %></h4>
    <div class="answer">
    <p>We highly recommend taking our <%= link_to "Web Development Primer class", "/webdevelopmentprimer.html" %> if you would like a low-risk introduction to programming.</p>
    <p>Our classes provide an accelerated learning program, so you should be prepared to treat your time at Portland Code School like a professional job. If you do find that our classes are too much for you, or that programming is simply not your thing, then we will pro-rate any remaining tuition.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- <div class="question">
  <h4><%= link_to "When is the application deadline?", "#" %></h4>
  <div class="answer">
    <p>For our core classes (Full Stack JavaScript Immersion and Evening), the deadline is currently 2 weeks before the start date.</p>
    <p>We do accept applications on an ongoing basis, so to secure your seat in any class, we encourage you to apply as early as possible.</p>
    <p>For workshops and seminar series (Primer and Data Viz currently), applications are due one week before the start date. But again, the earlier you apply, the more likely you are to secure your seat.</p>
  </div>
</div> -->

<div class="question">
  <h4><%= link_to "When do classes start?", "#" %></h4>

    <h2>Javascript</h2>
    <p>Portland Code School Winter 2014 Session

Full Stack JavaScript

Hours: 6pm-9pm, Mon/Wed + 1 Saturday per month, 9am-4pm

<p>This course is designed to help students learn how to build web applications and interactive website features from scratch using JavaScript as the primary language. Students will learn both front-end and back-end applications of JavaScript (including jQuery, BackboneJS, and NodeJS). Every web application needs JavaScript, so it’s an extremely powerful language to know, and the demand for JavaScript frameworks such as BackboneJS is only growing.</p>

<p>NOTE: Students with NO CODING EXPERIENCE should consider our Primer course before diving in to Full Stack JavaScript (see the Classes page for technical requirements).
Students will be provided Treehouse accounts, and will be given access to the classroom from 9am-5pm M-F, as well as some Saturdays, leaving lots of time for independent and group learning. Students will primarily be working and learning in groups of 2-4 peop
<p> 
The Saturdays that are scheduled learning times (1 Saturday each month) will primarily consist of team building, portfolio development, and other technical areas (such as Github and Chrome’s Developer Tools) to round out the students’ curriculum, and broaden their exposure to web development tools.
</p>
<p>
Integrating oneself into the Portland tech community is possibly the single best decision a new student can make. Forging connections and friendships by attending tech meetups and events is the best way to do this. We cannot force you to do this, but we will try (in a loving way :)
</p>
<p>
PCS hosts and sponsors community events periodically. Some of these will be organized and run by our students.
Another powerful way for web developers to put their best foot forward -- and be extra attractive to employers -- is to contribute to open source projects. We will cover best practices and different ways to make this happen in the latter part of the course.
</p>
</p>

    <h2>Ruby on Rails</h2>
    <p>Portland Code School Winter 2014 Session

Ruby on Rails

Hours: 6pm-9pm, Tue/Thurs + some Saturdays 9am-Noon + 1 Saturday per month, 9am-4pm
<p>
This class is designed to teach students how build interactive and dynamic web applications using Ruby on Rails. We start with an intense 1-month refresher on the Ruby language. After that, we dive into the Rails framework, still building our Ruby skills. Students will be expected to spend 2-3 hours studying outside of class for every hour spent in class.
</p>
<p>
Students will be provided Treehouse accounts, and will be given access to the classroom from 9am-5pm M-F, as well as some Saturdays, leaving lots of time for independent and group learning. Students will primarily be working and learning in groups of 2-4 people. Also, PCS hosts a happy hour every other Friday at local restaurants to give students a chance to meet outside of class in a social environment.
</p>
<p>
The Saturdays that are scheduled learning times (1 Saturday each month) will primarily consist of team building, portfolio development, and other technical areas (such as jQuery, GitHub and the Chrome Dev Tools) to round out the students’ curriculum, and broaden their exposure to web development tools.

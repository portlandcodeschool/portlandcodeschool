  Portland Code School launched its first class in September 2012, as an offshoot of development shop Burnside Digital, under the guidance of Chuck Lauer Vose, who saw a growing gap between the skills attainable through local colleges and the skills necessary to be a successful software developer in the business world. Since then, PCS has developed a broad curriculum of the most in-demand programming courses, and continues to place more than 90% of its graduates with employers throughout the area.
  </p>
  <p>
  We are indebted to a great many people for this success and would like to give <%= link_to "special thanks", "/thanks.html" %> for their help making this possible.

<!-- <div class="row">

  <p>Our curriculum is designed to take talented, motivated people from zero skills to engaged, challenging employment, whether they want to work from home as freelancers or they want to join a high-tech company as a full-time developer. Our programs are not easy - they take lots of work, dedication, study, and effort over a relatively short period of time. But we have a track record of placing nearly all of our students in interesting, lucrative web development positions.</p>

  <p>All PCS classes employ a broad spectrum of teaching methods: screencasts, online interactive training, instructor-led discussions and design workshops, and team-oriented project-based programming activities. PCS maintains an open classroom where students can congregate at any time of the day to work on projects, do homework, or interact with instructor/mentors. PCS instructors and students support and participate in local development community activities.</p>

  <p>PCS cultivates an employer network of high-technology software development companies, placement companies, and employment agencies who provide time, people, and resources to help PCS students learn state-of-the-art skills and find internships, temporary contracts, and entry-level jobs.</p>
